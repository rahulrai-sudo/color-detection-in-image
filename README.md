# color-detection-in-image

About: 
=======
Colour detection is the process of detecting the name of any color. This project can automatically get
the name of the color by clicking on them. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values. 
Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one. 


Execution:
========
run the color_detection.py with the image name/path as the argument.
eg: python color_detection.py -i colorpic.jpg

Remember to give the full path of image if it it in a different directory

Requirements:
--------------
1. OpenCV    https://docs.opencv.org/
2. Pandas    https://pandas.pydata.org/
3. Python    https://www.python.org/
